        Arrange the cards so that in the top 25 circles, all the cards in the
        same row, column, or diagonal have the same character in common.
        (Remember that diagonals wrap around.)
      </p>
      <p style="width: 1000px">
        Start by choosing any character, and placing all the cards with that
        character in the bottom six circles. (These six circles form the line
        at infinity in the projective plane.)
